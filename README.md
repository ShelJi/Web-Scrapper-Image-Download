## What is Web Scrapping

Web scraping is the process of using automated tools, often called bots or crawlers, to extract data from websites. Unlike screen scraping, which only captures the visible image of a webpage, web scraping accesses and extracts the underlying HTML code and data stored within the website's database. This extracted data can then be used for various purposes, such as market research, price comparison, or content aggregation. [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8]  

- Bots/Crawlers: These are software programs designed to automatically visit websites and navigate through their content. [2, 9]  
- HTML Extraction: Web scrapers analyze the HTML code of a webpage to identify and extract specific data elements, such as product names, prices, descriptions, or images. [1, 2]  
- Data Storage: The extracted data is then stored in a structured format, like a CSV file or database, for further analysis or use. [1, 10]  

### Common uses of web scraping

- Market Research: Businesses can use web scraping to collect data on competitor prices, product features, and customer reviews. [1, 5]  
- Price Comparison: Web scrapers can automate the process of comparing prices from different online retailers. [1, 5]  
- Data Aggregation: Scraping allows for the collection of data from various websites to create a single, comprehensive dataset. [4, 5]  
- Search Engine Indexing: Search engines like Google use web crawlers to index websites and their content. [4, 11]  

### Important considerations

- Legality: While web scraping is legal for accessing publicly available information, it's crucial to respect website terms of service and avoid scraping protected data like confidential information.
- Ethical Usage: Overusing web scrapers and overloading websites can cause issues and is generally considered unethical.
- Technical Considerations: Some websites employ anti-scraping measures to prevent automated data extraction, requiring developers to use advanced techniques to overcome these challenges. [12, 12, 13, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
